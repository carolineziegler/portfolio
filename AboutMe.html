												<h2>Biography</h2>
												<p>Brief Introduction to Myself</p>
											</header>

											<p>Hello! I'm Caroline, an enthusiastic, highly motivated undergraduate student at Dublin City University, driven by a profound passion for strategy, data analytics, and corporate finance, with a special focus on the healthcare sector. My journey in academia and professional experiences has allowed me to cultivate a unique set of skills and insights.</p>

											<p>I am currently immersed in the pursuit of a B.Sc. in International Management at ESB Business School, coupled with a B.A. in Global Business, majoring in Data Analytics at Dublin City University. Throughout my academic journey, I have enriched my learning through three impactful internships.</p>
											
											<p>As a Consulting Intern at Roland Berger GmbH in Munich, I actively contributed to healthcare restructuring, demonstrating my ability to analyze board and organizational structures of a German university hospital. Independently conducting evaluations, identifying optimization potentials, and creating Excel models showcased my commitment to quantitative analyses. Building on this experience, my tenure as a Strategy Consulting Intern at Accenture Plc. further solidified my strategic acumen. Playing a pivotal role in transformative projects, from the S/4 HANA aviation transformation to the redesign of finance divisions in machine engineering, underscored my dedication to impactful transformations. My venture into Marketing and Product Management at Lilly Deutschland GmbH allowed me to implement digital marketing strategies in the prescription pharmaceuticals sector, highlighting my versatility across diverse facets of business.</p>
											
											<p>Since childhood, my enthusiasm for numbers and logical thinking has driven me. This passion led me to choose the Data Analytics focus, aiming to expand my knowledge of data science and acquire crucial hard skills like Python and SQL. In the following portfolio, I meticulously showcase my journey in Data Analytics—detailing the skills acquired, the topics explored, and practical applications of my expertise.</p>

												<h2>Resume</h2>
												<p>Career Path and Outlook</p>
											</header>

											<p>Guided by an abiding enthusiasm for strategy, health and the pharmaceutical industry, my professional journey has unfolded through diverse chapters, ultimately culminating in the forthcoming completion of my bachelor’s degree in May 2024. In 2019, I proudly graduated from high school in Tübingen, where my studies centered on German, mathematics, French, and music. Notably, during my school years, I eagerly volunteered to lead the volleyball club across three high schools in Tübingen.</p>

											<p>Embarking on the academic odyssey of International Management at ESB Business School in Reutlingen in September 2020, my commitment extended beyond the classroom. I assumed roles such as Head of Logistics for the Economic Forum, Delegate for the National Model of United Nations, and Ambassador for the foundation of my scholarship, amplifying my dedication to both academic and philanthropic pursuits. My inaugural internship at Eli Lilly in marketing and product management became a pivotal juncture, illuminating the depth of my passion for the healthcare sector. In September 2022, my academic journey continued at Dublin City University, marking the inception of a new phase. Subsequently, I undertook a second internship, this time in strategy consulting at Accenture, followed by an enriching experience at Roland Berger, specializing in healthcare strategy consulting. Concurrently, I embraced responsibilities as the Society Coordinator for my degree program at DCU and acted as a spokesperson for my foundation in the Ireland region.</p>

											<p>Throughout these diverse experiences, I not only reaffirmed my passion for the healthcare sector but also actively pursued my quest for continuous learning, drawing inspiration from the many remarkable individuals I encountered. Looking ahead, my future endeavors are poised to integrate my focus on data analytics, with a vision to seamlessly intertwine this expertise with the healthcare sector, embodying an ideal convergence of passion and proficiency. Consequently, I aim at achieving a role as either healthcare consultant with a focus on digitalization and integration of data analytics or as Data Analyst in an international pharmaceutical or healthcare company.</p>
