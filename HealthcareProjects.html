												<h2 id="section1">Impact of COVID-19 on Hospital Capacity in the USA</h2>
												<p>Data Preprocessing, SARIMAX and RandomForestClassifier</p>
											</header>
											<p>The dataset detailing the impact of COVID-19 on hospital capacities was meticulously selected for its comprehensive scope and alignment with stringent privacy and security standards, including compliance with regulations and GDPR. This careful selection process ensures that while providing invaluable insights into the challenges faced by healthcare systems during the pandemic, it simultaneously upholds the highest standards of data privacy and security. No personal patient information is included, focusing instead on aggregated hospital capacity metrics, which sidesteps potential privacy concerns and emphasizes the project's commitment to ethical data handling practices. This approach not only respects individuals' rights but also instills trust in the data analysis process, reinforcing the importance of privacy and security in healthcare analytics.</p>

											<p>In my project, I embarked on an in-depth analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on hospital capacity and staffing across various states in the USA, utilizing a rich dataset that explored patient impact and hospital capacity over time. The dataset was first imported into my analysis environment using Python. This initial step allowed me to gain a fundamental understanding of the dataset's structure and the nature of its inputs.</p>

											<p>Upon initial exploration, it became evident that the dataset suffered from high dimensionality, boasting 134 columns. To refine my analysis and focus on the aspects most critical to understanding hospital capacity needs and staff shortages, I selected a subset of columns. These included state, date, critical staffing shortages today, inpatient beds used for COVID-19, total adult and pediatric patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19, inpatient beds, inpatient beds used, total staffed adult ICU beds, and staffed adult ICU bed occupancy. This selection process was pivotal in narrowing down the data to manageable and analytically useful dimensions.</p>

											<p>The next step involved cleaning the data, a critical process given the presence of missing values in several columns. By dropping these missing values, I ensured the reliability and accuracy of subsequent analyses. The data was then further refined by converting the 'date' column to a datetime format, facilitating time-series analysis.</p>

											<p>Analyzing the data revealed significant insights into hospital capacity utilization and critical staffing shortages across different states. To illustrate, I plotted the usage of inpatient beds for COVID-19 over time in states such as California, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, and Florida. These visual representations highlighted the fluctuations in bed usage, underscoring the pandemic's waves and the resultant pressures on hospital capacities.</p>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/COVID19_criticalstaffing.png" alt="" /></span>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/COVID19_inpatientbed.png" alt="" /></span>

											<p>Further analysis using seaborn's line plots shed light on the critical staffing shortage situations over time, particularly between July 2020 and January 2022. This analysis not only highlighted the temporal patterns of staffing shortages but also revealed the differences between states. Additionally, by calculating the national average of bed utilization and staffing shortages over time, I gained a holistic understanding of hospital capacity utilization and staffing challenges on a national scale.</p>
											
											<p>To predict future hospital capacity needs, I employed time series analysis techniques, specifically the SARIMAX model. After preparing the data and ensuring its stationarity, I trained the model using data from California, forecasting the future use of inpatient beds for COVID-19. Despite the model's predictions of a continuous decrease, the actual trend showed an increase, indicating the complexity and unpredictability of the pandemic's impact on hospital capacities.</p>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/COVID19_forecast.png" alt="" /></span>

											<p>Recognizing the importance of predicting critical staffing shortages, I applied a RandomForestClassifier due to its robustness and ability to handle non-linear data without the need for feature scaling. The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 95.46%, demonstrating its efficacy in predicting hospitals facing critical staffing shortages. Given the model's success, I also explored the use of Logistic Regression for comparative analysis. However, the Logistic Regression model yielded lower accuracy and robustness, leading me to conclude that the RandomForestClassifier was the preferred model for this particular dataset.</p>

												<h2 id="section3">Diabetes Analysis and Deep Learning</h2>
												<p>Descriptive Statistic in R and Deep Learning in Python</p>
											</header>
											
											<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
											<p>This comprehensive project explores the application of both descriptive statistical analysis and deep learning models to predict the onset of diabetes using a robust dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes crucial diagnostic measures such as Glucose level, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, BMI, Insulin, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age, which are vital for identifying potential diabetes indicators.</p>

											<p><strong>Descriptive Statistical Analysis in R</strong></p>
											<p>The initial phase of the project employed R's tidyverse suite, particularly the dplyr and ggplot2 packages, to manipulate and analyze the data effectively. A critical examination of variables like Glucose and Blood Pressure in relation to diabetes outcomes was conducted. Visualization techniques highlighted significant trends, with elevated glucose levels showing a strong correlation with the incidence of diabetes. A detailed correlation matrix was constructed to elucidate the interdependencies among features, pinpointing Glucose as a key predictor. This phase underscored the predictive power of Glucose levels, the interplay between BMI and insulin resistance, and moderate correlations involving age and pregnancies, providing a foundation for further predictive modeling.</p>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Diabetes_featuredistribution.png" alt="" /></span>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Diabetes_correlationmatrix.png" alt="" /></span>

											<p><strong>Deep Learning Model for Diabetes Prediction</strong></p>
											<p>Subsequently, the project involved developing a deep learning model to predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures included within a healthcare dataset. The dataset, containing several medical predictors such as Glucose level, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, BMI, and others, was leveraged to determine its potential in predicting the binary outcome of diabetes presence. The initial step of the project focused on data preparation and preprocessing, which is critical for any machine learning task. Given that machine learning algorithms require numerical input, preprocessing involved handling potential issues such as missing values and zero entries in contexts where they were biologically implausible, like a zero Glucose level. These zero entries were replaced with the median of their respective columns to retain the integrity of the dataset while providing meaningful input for the model. The next phase centered around feature scaling to standardize the range of independent variables. This normalization ensured that each feature contributed equally to the analysis and the gradient descent optimization performed efficiently during the training phase. For the model architecture, a sequential neural network with multiple layers was constructed using TensorFlow and Keras. The network included dense layers with ReLU activation functions, interspersed with dropout layers to reduce overfitting. The model culminated in a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function to yield a binary output, reflecting the presence or absence of diabetes. Throughout the training process, which spanned 50 epochs with a batch size of 32, the model's performance was consistently monitored through validation loss and accuracy metrics. The final model achieved an accuracy of approximately 86.8% on the test dataset, a clear indication of its robustness. Feature importance was assessed using the permutation feature importance method. This method involved shuffling individual features and measuring the impact on model performance, providing a quantitative basis for feature significance. The analysis revealed which diagnostic measures were most influential, thereby offering potential insights into the physiological indicators of diabetes. The choice of the dataset was strategic, driven by the goal of understanding the application of deep learning in a critical healthcare domain. Diabetes, being a prevalent and impactful condition worldwide, presented a compelling case for the application of predictive modeling to aid in early diagnosis and management.</p>

												<h2 id="section4">Physician Retention Factor Analysis</h2>
												<p>CFA, Linear Regressions and MANCOVA</p>
											</header>

											<p><strong>Project Overview</strong></p>
											<p>This research project embarked on an in-depth exploration of the factors influencing the retention of physicians in German hospitals within a post-COVID-19 context. Recognizing the critical challenges facing the healthcare sector, including a pronounced physician shortage exacerbated by the pandemic, the study aimed to provide actionable insights into improving retention strategies.</p>

											<p><strong>Research Design</strong></p>
											<p>The project utilized a quantitative research design, employing a descriptive survey methodology to collect standardized data from a broad demographic of physicians. This approach was selected for its efficiency in examining the multifaceted nature of employee retention in healthcare settings, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the various factors impacting physician loyalty to their employers.</p>

											<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
											<p> 1.	To identify and analyze the key factors influencing physician retention in German hospitals post-COVID-19.</p>
											<p>	2.	To assess the applicability of the Framework of Continuance Model (FCM) in understanding physician retention, specifically within the evolving healthcare landscape.</p>
											<p>	3.	To provide recommendations for healthcare policymakers and hospital administrators on enhancing physician retention strategies.</p>

											<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
											<p>The study leveraged a meticulously designed survey instrument, divided into two sections. The first section focused on general factors affecting physician retention, such as demographic details and employment conditions. The second section operationalized the FCM, expanded with items to explore contractual aspects of retention comprehensively. This dual approach facilitated a holistic assessment of the retention landscape for physicians in Germany.
												Sampling was concentrated on the German healthcare sector, targeting hospitals of various types and sizes to ensure a diverse and representative data set. The online survey, conducted using Microsoft Forms, was distributed through multiple channels to maximize engagement and participation among the target group.</p>

											<p><strong>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</strong></p>
											<p>The project's initial analytical phase was centered around meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing, utilizing Python for its robust data manipulation capabilities. This stage was critical for ensuring the dataset's accuracy and reliability, setting a solid foundation for the complex statistical analyses that followed. The process involved several key procedures: Imputation of Missing Data involved addressing erroneous data entries through imputation techniques, mitigating the impact of missing information on the study's outcomes. Data Type Assignment required each column within the dataset to be meticulously evaluated to assign the correct data types, ensuring that subsequent analyses were based on accurately categorized information. Data Transformation included transforming thirteen categorical non-numeric variables to facilitate their inclusion in statistical models. Two primary methods were employed: One-Hot Encoding, applied to categorical variables lacking inherent order, transformed these variables into a format suitable for quantitative analysis without introducing ordinal bias, and Label Encoding, utilized for ordinal categorical variables, preserved the natural order of categories, enabling their effective incorporation into the analysis.</p>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/retention_corrmatrix.png" alt="" /></span>

											<p><strong>Scale Reliability and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)</strong></p>
											<p>Scale Reliability involved the internal consistency of the scales within the Framework of Continuance Model (FCM) section being evaluated using Cronbach's Alpha, a measure revered for its utility in assessing the coherence of psychometric instruments. This step ensured that the scales accurately reflected the constructs they were intended to measure. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted to rigorously test the hypothesized structure of the FCM against the collected empirical data. Unlike Principal Component Analysis, which serves as an exploratory tool, CFA provided a methodical approach to validate the model's applicability to our dataset. The analysis focused on two main aims: General Model Fit Analysis involved assessing the model's fit using relevant statistical indicators to confirm its suitability for our data. Calculation of Factor Scores, rather than averaging item scores per component, CFA enabled the calculation of factor scores in a quasi-weighted manner, increasing the accuracy and meaningfulness of each component's overall score.</p>
											<p><strong>Retention Model CFA</strong></p>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/RetentionModelFit.png" alt="" /></span>
											
											<p><strong>Linear Regression Analysis</strong></p>
											<p>Following the foundational steps of data preparation and model validation, the study progressed to the execution of linear regression models. This statistical method was selected for its effectiveness in dealing with continuous dependent variables, allowing for an in-depth exploration of the relationships between various factors and their influence on physician retention. Linear regression facilitated the identification of statistically significant predictors, providing a clear understanding of the dynamics at play within the retention of physicians in German hospitals post-COVID-19.</p>

											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Retention_codeLR.png" alt="" /></span>

											<p><strong>MANCOVA</strong></p>
											<p>The MANCOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Covariance) analysis conducted in this study aimed to holistically assess the influence of various factors on retention types within a healthcare setting. Utilizing the statsmodels library in Python, specifically the MANOVA class, the analysis structured around a comprehensive set of independent variables, including encoded representations of employee experience, employer type (ranging from Church Hospitals to University Hospitals), facility location, current position, work model, average weekly working hours, overtime compensation strategies, and ratings of current work conditions and staffing levels. Additional covariates like age and gender were also included to control for potential confounding effects. The dependent variables in the model were four different types of retention: Contractual, Normative, Cognitive, and Affective Retention. To capture the multifaceted relationships among these variables, the model equation was defined to combine all predictors, including covariates, with a syntax in the MANOVA.from_formula method that specified the dependent variables combined using a + symbol and separated from the predictors with a ~.
												
												Upon fitting the MANCOVA model to a subset of the data (subset_ER_analysis_Df), the results were generated using the mv_test() method. This analysis provided insights into the general model fit and individual factor scores, thereby allowing for a nuanced understanding of how each variable contributed to various types of retention. Factor scores were calculated in a quasi-weighted manner, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of the impact each component had on the retention outcomes.
												
												Additionally, to ensure the model's reliability, a Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis was conducted.</p>
											
											<p><strong>MANCOVA Code</strong></p>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Retention_codeMANCOVA.png" alt="" /></span>
										
											<p><strong>Findings and Implications</strong></p>
