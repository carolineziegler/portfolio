												<h2 id="section1">Demographics and Personality Dataset Analysis</h2>
												<p>Missing values imputation, dataset join and regression analyses</p>
											</header>

											<p>In this project, I embarked on an ambitious journey to explore and analyze demographic and personality data through a series of meticulous data preprocessing and analysis steps using Python. The project's scope aimed at normalizing and imputing missing values within a demographics dataset comprising 122 rows and 16 columns, followed by merging it with a personality dataset to perform a unified dataset analysis, yielding insights into correlations, personality differences, and genetic traits.</p>

											<p>The initial phase involved data normalization and imputation where I utilized Python's Pandas library to handle missing values across various columns such as daily travel to Dublin City University, CAO Points, average Year 1 exam results, seat row, and age. Notable techniques included partitioning the dataset to avoid imputation based on previously imputed data, employing mean substitution for daily travel distances, and utilizing linear regression models to estimate missing CAO Points and exam results. A median substitution was chosen for the missing age value, reflecting the dataset's distribution more accurately.</p>

										<p>Better understanding of music streaming users</p>
									</header>

									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/deezer.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>In the context of the Business Strategy module during the seventh and eighth semesters, a notable project involved the strategic analysis and consultation of a company. Specifically, my group undertook the task of conducting a comprehensive survey aimed at gaining profound insights into the consumer base of music streaming providers. The survey encompassed inquiries regarding participants' demographics and their current status as customers or non-customers of music streaming services.</p>

									<p>Upon categorizing participants into non-customers and customers, distinct sets of questions were directed towards each group. For non-customers, the primary focus was on elucidating the reasons underpinning their decision to refrain from utilizing a music streaming platform. Conversely, customers were queried on various aspects, including their preferred platforms, streaming behavior, satisfaction levels, and an assessment of specific features. To execute this survey, Google Forms was initially employed. However, the analysis conducted through Google Forms proved to be insufficient, lacking in depth, and necessitating data cleaning. Consequently, the dataset underwent a meticulous cleaning process and was subjected to a more detailed analysis and visualization using Python.</p>

									<p>The Python analysis concentrated on columns where Google Forms did not yield definitive results, particularly those involving free-form fields or open-ended response options. Although not every column underwent detailed analysis in Python, an efficient focus was directed towards pivotal columns. The dataset was initially cleansed by adjusting column headings, eliminating irrelevant columns, and rectifying errors in input, ensuring a coherent dataset for subsequent analysis.</p>

									<p>Demographic analyses were performed on all survey participants prior to the creation of two distinct data subsets: one for non-customers and another for customers. Both subsets underwent a re-evaluation of demographics, followed by visualization. Subsequently, non-customer columns were cleared and clustered to elucidate reasons for abstaining from music streaming, alongside alternative preferences. For the customer dataset, a K-Means algorithm was employed to cluster responses to free-form texts on satisfaction and dissatisfaction into five clusters each. This clustering facilitated the exploration of relationships between music streaming platforms and satisfaction or dissatisfaction reasons, visualized through scatterplots. Furthermore, critical insights gleaned from the data were visually presented.</p>

									<p>The refined and in-depth results obtained through the Python analysis were crucial in formulating findings and recommendations. The synthesized data analysis was then exported and encapsulated in an Excel file for submission, providing a comprehensive and well-supported strategic analysis and consulting report.</p>

									<p>The data underwent a meticulous cleaning process, including the exclusion of responses from participants under 18 for compliance reasons. A significant challenge arose from the nature of the survey, where a substantial portion of questions allowed for free-form responses. Consequently, our primary mission became the segmentation of these diverse answers into cohesive clusters for a more insightful analysis and visualization. A paramount objective of our analysis was to explore potential correlations, specifically investigating whether age played a role in determining price sensitivity for our product. Surprisingly, no discernible correlation was found in this respect, challenging initial assumptions.</p>

									<p>Through the meticulous cleansing, analysis, and visualization of data using Python, we not only gained valuable insights but also utilized this refined information for the feasibility study of our product. The synthesis of our Python analysis findings was efficiently compiled in Excel, underscoring the pivotal role Python played in making the data actionable for our project. In essence, the success of our analysis owes a significant debt to the power and flexibility afforded by Python in handling complex data sets.</p>
